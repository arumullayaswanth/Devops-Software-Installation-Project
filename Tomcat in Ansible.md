# Apache Tomcat installing  Ansibe
## Overview

Apache Tomcat is an open-source implementation of Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and WebSocket technologies. It is developed by the Apache Software Foundation and is widely used to deploy Java-based web applications. Tomcat acts as a lightweight application server, providing a reliable environment for running Java applications.

### Features of Apache Tomcat:

- **Lightweight and Fast:** Optimized for Java web applications.
- **Servlet & JSP Support:** Implements the latest Java EE specifications.
- **Security Features:** Provides role-based access control, SSL, and authentication mechanisms.
- **Integration with Web Servers:** Can be used alongside Apache HTTP Server for scalability.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

        url: "https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.102/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.102.tar.gz"
        dest: "/root/"

    - name: untar the apache file
      command: tar -zxvf apache-tomcat-9.0.102.tar.gz


    - name: rename the tomcat
      command: mv apache-tomcat-9.0.102 tomcat
      tags: abc

    - name: install java
      command: yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y

    - name: setting the roles in tomcat-user.xml file
      template:
        src: tomcat-users.xml
        dest: /root/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml

    - name: delete two lines in context.xml
      template:
        src: context.xml

  By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
  to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
  you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary.

  Built-in Tomcat manager roles:
    - manager-gui    - allows access to the HTML GUI and the status pages
    - manager-script - allows access to the HTTP API and the status pages
    - manager-jmx    - allows access to the JMX proxy and the status pages
    - manager-status - allows access to the status pages only

  The users below are wrapped in a comment and are therefore ignored. If you
  wish to configure one or more of these users for use with the manager web
  application, do not forget to remove the <!.. ..> that surrounds them. You
  will also need to set the passwords to something appropriate.

## How to Use
1. Save the above files (`tomcat.yml`, `tomcat-users.xml`, `context.xml`) in your Ansible directory.
2. Run the playbook using:
   ```sh
   vim tomcat.yml
   ```
   ```sh
   vim tomcat-users.xml
   ```
   ```sh
   vim context.xml
   ```
   ```sh
   ansible-playbook tomcat.yml
   ```
3. Access Tomcat via `http://your-server-ip:8080/`.
4. Log in to the Tomcat Manager using the credentials from `tomcat-users.xml`.

---

## Notes
- Ensure you have Ansible installed on your system before running the playbook.
- Modify the `tomcat-users.xml` file to set a more secure password before deploying in production.
- The playbook assumes a root directory `/root/` for simplicity; adjust paths if necessary.
